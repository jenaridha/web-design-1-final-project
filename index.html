         <p>My name is Jena Ridha and I am currently a student of Graphic Design at Algonquin College.</p>
         
         <p>Through my studies, I have developed a solid foundation in design principles and have gained experience with a variety of design tools, including Adobe Creative Suite (Photoshop, Illustrator, InDesign), Figma, and Sketch.</p>
         
         <p>I am passionate about typography, layout design, and branding. I have also had the opportunity to experiment with other areas of design, such as motion graphics and web design.</p> </div>
